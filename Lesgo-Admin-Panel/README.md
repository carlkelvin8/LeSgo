## Requirements

- PHP 8.3 or newer (with `pdo_pgsql` for production)
- Composer
- Node.js and npm
- PostgreSQL 14+ — the admin panel MUST connect to the **same database as the LesGo API** so fee approvals/waivers are visible to the API. A separate MySQL database will silently break driver/merchant activation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository and enter the project directory.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/carlkelvin8/Lesgo-Admin-Panel.git
   cd Lesgo-Admin-Panel
   ```

2. Install dependencies and create the environment file.

   ```bash
   composer install
   npm install
   cp .env.example .env
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

3. Point the admin panel at the **same database the API uses**. Copy the
   connection values from the API's `.env` (PostgreSQL, database `lesgo_api`).
   Do not create a separate `lesgo_admin` database — the admin panel must write
   into the API's database for fee approvals/waivers to take effect.

   ```dotenv
   DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
   DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
   DB_PORT=5432
   DB_DATABASE=lesgo_api
   DB_USERNAME=postgres
   DB_PASSWORD=
   ```

4. Update the credentials in `.env` if your setup differs from the defaults.

5. Build and initialize the application.

   ```bash
   php artisan migrate --seed
   npm run build
   php artisan serve
   ```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/login`.

## Development Admin Account

- Email: `admin@lesgo.com`
- Password: `password`

Change this password immediately outside local development.

In production, the seeder will only create/update the administrator when
`ADMIN_PASSWORD` is explicitly configured for a new account. Existing accounts
can be repaired without resetting their password by setting `ADMIN_EMAIL`,
`ADMIN_NAME`, and `ADMIN_ROLE`, then running `AdminSeeder`.

## Testing

The automated tests use an isolated SQLite in-memory database; the application itself defaults to MySQL.

```bash
php artisan test
```

## Password Reset Email

The local environment defaults to the `log` mailer. Reset links are written to `storage/logs/laravel.log`. Configure a production mail provider in `.env` before deployment.

## Production Operations

Run migrations during deployment and configure a persistent queue worker:

```bash
php artisan migrate --force
php artisan db:seed --class=SecuritySettingsSeeder --force
php artisan queue:work --queue=notifications,default --tries=3 --timeout=60
```

Email notifications use the configured Laravel mailer. Firebase push uses the
FCM HTTP v1 API and accepts either `FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS` (service-account JSON
file path) or `FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_BASE64` plus `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`. SMS uses
the provider-neutral `SMS_WEBHOOK_URL` and optional `SMS_WEBHOOK_TOKEN`.

The August 19 operations migration is additive: it does not remove or rename
existing mobile columns, and partial refunds remain `paid` in the existing
payment status until the full amount has been refunded.
